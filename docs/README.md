## **üìå To-Do List: Migration & Enhancements**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Migrate from Flask to TypeScript (üöÄ Major Task)**
- [ ] Set up a new backend using TypeScript with Express.js or Fastify  
- [ ] Implement TypeScript types for API requests, responses, and database models  
- [ ] Replace Python-based file handling logic with TypeScript equivalents  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Secure & Isolated File Scanning**  
- [ ] Run file scanning inside an isolated environment (Docker, Firecracker)  
- [ ] Integrate open-source sandboxing (e.g., Cuckoo Sandbox)  
- [ ] Ensure proper access control for uploaded files  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Scalable File Processing & Storage**  
- [ ] Implement a queue-based processing system (RabbitMQ/Kafka)  
- [ ] Support large file uploads with chunked/resumable uploads  
- [ ] Store files in MinIO or a distributed file system  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ ML Model Integration & Optimization**  
- [ ] Convert Python-based ML integration to TypeScript-compatible services  
- [ ] Optimize the ML model for real-time analysis  
- [ ] Implement model versioning and update mechanisms  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Layered Virus Scanning**  
- [ ] Integrate ClamAV/YARA for signature-based scanning  
- [ ] Add ML-based detection for heuristic analysis  
- [ ] Implement multi-engine scanning workflow  

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Security & API Hardening**  
- [ ] Implement file validation to prevent malicious uploads  
- [ ] Add API authentication & rate limiting (JWT, OAuth, API keys)  
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)  

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Failure Handling**  
- [ ] Implement system health checks with Prometheus + Grafana  
- [ ] Track scanning failures and implement retry mechanisms  
- [ ] Log API and scanning activity for auditing  

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ API & Documentation Improvements**  
- [ ] Document API endpoints using OpenAPI (Swagger)  
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for backend stability  
- [ ] Improve README with setup instructions and examples
