# 🚀 Scalable File Upload & ML-Based Virus Scanning

A **real-time**, **scalable**, and **secure** file scanning system that uses **machine learning** (ML) to detect potential threats. This project focuses on **modular architecture**, **distributed processing**, and **TypeScript-based backend migration** for enhanced security.

---

## 📋 To-Do List

We are improving this project with a **step-by-step refactoring** approach. Below is the prioritized list of tasks from **most complex** to **easiest**:

### 🏗 **High-Priority / Complex Tasks**
1. **Isolate the Scanning Process** – Run the scanning service in a secure, isolated environment (e.g., Dockerized sandbox or VM).
2. **Implement Asynchronous & Distributed Processing** – Ensure scalable and high-performance scanning.
3. **Migrate Backend from Flask to TypeScript** – Improve security and maintainability.
4. **Enhance Security Measures** – Sandboxing, rate limiting, request validation, and API authentication.
5. **Support Multi-OS Scanning Services** – Enable scanning on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### ⚡ **Medium-Priority Tasks**
6. **Improve Failure Detection & Monitoring** – Implement logging and real-time alerts.
7. **Add Support for Dynamic Script Updates** – Allow new scanning rules and ML models to be added without downtime.
8. **Refactor Code Structure** – Organize the codebase for scalability and maintainability.
9. **Database Optimization & Efficient File Storage** – Use appropriate data models and storage solutions.

### 🛠 **Low-Priority / Easier Tasks**
10. **Improve Documentation** – Expand API documentation, guides, and examples.
11. **Add Unit & Integration Tests** – Improve code quality and reliability.
12. **Enhance CI/CD Pipelines** – Automate deployments using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
13. **Improve Logging & Metrics** – Use Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring.
14. **Optimize Performance** – Reduce scanning latency and optimize processing.
