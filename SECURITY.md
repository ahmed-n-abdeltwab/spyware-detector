## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of our system, we implement:

‚úÖ **File Scanning Isolation**: Each uploaded file is scanned in an isolated environment.  
‚úÖ **Asynchronous & Distributed Processing**: Reduces risk by separating ML scanning from the main system.  
‚úÖ **Rate Limiting & Authentication**: Prevents abuse and unauthorized access.  
‚úÖ **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypted file storage and hashed metadata.  
‚úÖ **Regular Security Audits**: We continuously test for vulnerabilities.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow [CVD (Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure)](https://www.first.org/cvss/) best practices. If you report a valid vulnerability, we will work with you on a responsible disclosure timeline.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure! üöÄ
